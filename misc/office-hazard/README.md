# Office Hazard

The office is a dangerous place. Last week Pam (the secretary) got an email, containing an archive. She ALMOST opened it, but then she remembered the IT security training from last month and fortunately decided to send the file to you. Somethings was *phishy* about the sender address to her. It was a close call to say the least...


**IMPORTANT NOTES**
- This challenge cannot be solved on any file systems other than NTFS.
- If you want to see the challenge in action, you have to use a Windows box with Office installed. In addition, add the folder where the challenge is extracted to to `Trusted Locations` ([help for that](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-remove-or-change-a-trusted-location-7ee1cdc2-483e-4cbb-bcb3-4e7c67147fb4)). The challenge can be solved without actually running anything.
- Windows Defender and other AVs might flag the files as dangerous, these are false positive alerts.
