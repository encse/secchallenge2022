# Dangerous Volcano

Hi there Bob,

There is this rival IT Security company called `securityZilla`, that is undermining our contracts with some dirty tactics and we don't want to go out of business because of them.

I'm taking you off the `Fancy Mamba` case, and from now on your task is to find out something compromising about this firm. Their public website is https://securityzilla.secchallenge.crysys.hu.

The codename of the project is `Dangerous Volcano`.

Report to me when you find something,

Dan

Note: This is **not** a web challenge!  
Also, any connection with last year's `Lost & Found` challenge or with any twitter, github or flickr user profiles, is purely coincidental.
