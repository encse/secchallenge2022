# Black box

You arrive at the hacker's headquarters too late. They have already left, and either destroyed all their equipment or took them with themselves. There is not a single working electronic device in the room. You think you have reached a dead end, when you notice a small piece of paper behind a desk. There is an IP address and a port on the paper; not much, but something you can start working with.
