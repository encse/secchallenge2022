# heap-quest

Ah so you claim to be a mighty hero!
Let's see how you perform in the wilderness of the heap!

This challenge contains two flags. One is easier than the other.
Only the content of `flag` file is accepted on ctfd,
so if you manage to acquire it, you receive max points.
BUT if you find the other one as well and send it to `tcs` on Discord,
you may in return get hyperclapped.
