# che%s%s

Ohh no! Someone just broke into our system!

Ok, now they are stealing the source code of our unbeatable `che%s%s` engine.
Aaaand we are locked out of our `che%s%s` service...

We managed to capture their modified source code while the bad folks uploaded a new version of our software.

Could you help us get inside again?
