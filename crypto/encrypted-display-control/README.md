# Encrypted Display Control

You intercepted an encrypted control secquence which controls a matrix display (see `proto_msgs.crypt`). Recover the plaintext stream, extract the control sequence from it, and use the display simulator to get the flag! The specification of the display and the encryption algorithm is described in `description.md`.
