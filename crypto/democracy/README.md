I did not want to have to call you, Agent, but this is an EMERGENCY!
The recent PR disasters are ruining Mr. Mcmillan's chances at winning the ongoing local election, and I need YOU to pull us out of this mess.
The city recently started using a secure e-voting system, but my sources tell me it was implemented by some amateur.

I bet you can hack it and win us the election! You shall be handsomely rewarded!

We attached all the information we have to this message.
