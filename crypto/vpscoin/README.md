Well, here we go again. Two years ago we already tried this, it didn't go too well, but hey, you only fail if you give up. ü¶æ

What's more it turns out that our ideas were ahead of our time back than, since stuff like this is really popular right now.
*What are you talking about?*, you ask, well, I can't blame you, we actually messed up pretty hard last time, so we didn't have the opportunity to become famous. So if you haven't heard about us before, here is our original release announcement:
```
Our brand new PaaS is finally open to the public. Unfortunately we don't have the necessary physical infrastructure to provide big amounts of compute power, but we didn't want to miss out on such a great market, so we found a way. Instead of going for quantity, we went for quality: you will have a chance to run your code on the computer of our CEO. Just imagine the premium feel, the honor of executing code on the machine of such a powerful and accomplished man! There will surely be many people who want to experience something like that, I'm sure the service will be very successful.

Of course, there are many important and sensitive documents on the computer of our CEO, so we can't just let you run code unchecked. Luckily, we have a cutting edge dynamic analysis framework, so if you send it there, we can verify that it doesn't do anything nefarious, so you can send it to the CEO and we can verify that its the same program by comparing md5 hashes. üîí
```

*What went wrong? ü§î This idea is actually genius, why haven't I heard about you guys?*, you might ask next. Despite our revolutionary ideas, we too are only human, and made some implementation mistakes, that allowed users to escape our sandboxes, and long story short, we went bust.

But, the story is not over yet, as a few months ago we successfully disputed most of the demand notices that the bank sent for our internal organs. These bankruptcy laws are funny nowadays if you are not a big corporation I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. But we are back in business and ready to try again. Also one of us is missing a kidney but business requires sacrifices from everyone.

The first thing to do is always market research, after all, we have been out of the game for two years, who knows whether our product ideas are still profitable. Nowadays artificial scarcity became all the rage, just look at the various NFTs you can buy that let's you prove to people that you own a link to a picture (although, anyone else can access the picture too, and whoever is hosting the picture [could change what is stored on that link](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html), but I guess that doesn't bother anyone too much). But the craze is not limited to digital items, just the other day [Lay's announced](https://www.brandeating.com/2022/01/lays-reveals-new-potato-chips-made-from-potatoes-grown-in-dirt-taken-from-nfl-stadiums.html) they will sell premium potato chips grown in soil taken from NFL stadiums. Just imagine how much better those must taste than the ones grown in normal soil.

So you can imagine how happy we were when we got up to speed with things, if things like these can take off, we have a solid market to capture. What's more, we barely have anything to change. Just have to fix the sandbox escape and we are good to go. üéâ This time you have to submit your programs in our custom architecture with just a few opcodes. In fact it's so simple I'm not even going to bother documenting it, you can have the code of the interpreter. 

Well, that's all, have at it. For the low low price of $1/byte, you too can run your code on the computer of our CEO, you can submit your code here:
