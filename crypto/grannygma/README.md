# GRANNYGMA

My grandmother always sends her favorite english metal lyrics of the week (FEMLOTW) to me. She's rather privacy-aware so she encrypts everything, however, the best encryption method she knows is her Enigma machine from way back when it was bleeding edge technology. We both have a little notebook that contains the settings for each week. Unfortunately I forgot where I put it then spilled coffee on it and after that my dog ate it (send help) so I don't know this week's settings.

I REALLY want to know the lyrics of the week and she said she found some kind of flag or what in her crossword puzzle that she wanted to share with me. Can you help?

The ciphertext I got was: `ROOGUDACKYZIRZOGDESRDEFSAPZWNDJMMEIDUFHDEALCESFDRSELOFNMESSQBSPFHCJVGOZFYPHHKJIXXIBAAGZFXBXZQTSFMBNDFKXVVAOZUVARLRDNBKDFWTIYQEXYAHRLAFYZHCVNWMIIBVYSIVSYMCGZIGIHQMXWBOBJFZATIAJVBGWENEDQPPYTAEJJRHCFJMVDYWDHHXPOTXCGWFZPZS`

I've gathered everything that might help you:
- We have five different rotors but our machines can only take three
- We use four or five plugs
- We always use the `B` reflector
- I have three previous letters that I kept, I don't know how they might help, but here they are:
```none
===================================================
HELLO MY SWEET HANS

I AM IRON MAN
HAS HE LOST HIS MIND
CAN HE SEE OR IS HE BLIND
CAN HE WALK AT ALL
OR IF HE MOVES WILL HE FALL

XOXO
===================================================
HELLO MY SWEET HANS

THERE I WAS COMPLETELY WASTING OUT OF WORK AND DOWN
ALL INSIDE ITS SO FRUSTRATING AS I DRIFT FROM TOWN TO TOWN
FEEL AS THOUGH NOBODY CARES IF I LIVE OR DIE
SO I MIGHT AS WELL BEGIN TO PUT SOME ACTION IN MY LIFE
YOU KNOW WHAT ITS CALLED
BREAKING THE LAW BREAKING THE LAW

LOTS OF LOVE
===================================================
HELLO MY SWEET HANS

IF YOU LIKE TO GAMBLE I TELL YOU IM YOUR MAN
YOU WIN SOME LOSE SOME ALL THE SAME TO ME
THE PLEASURE IS TO PLAY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHAT YOU SAY
I DONT SHARE YOUR GREED THE ONLY CARD I NEED IS THE ACE OF SPADES
THE ACE OF SPADES

YOUR GRANNY
===================================================

*Note: The flag is in all caps without whitespaces in the usual `cd22{*}` format.*
