# Martian Quest: The Terraformation

The mission of Ares III was to terraform the Mars. It started well with some breakthroughs, but the quest failed due to a big dust storm. And now, we lost one man, alone on a distant planet. We must find and evacuate him. The Nasa cannot afford such a scandal. You can use all the devices and anything what we have on the Earth and on the Mars. Just find him and contact him.
