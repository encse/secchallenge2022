# Drive to checkered flag

Hey man. I cannot believe this Spanish dude is faster than you on your home track, I think they're cheating. I've already told this to Mr. Director and the Judges, but they couldn't find anything irregular. Their best offer was P2... They don't understand shit... So we collected some data about the pole lap. Unfortunately, the video crashed after a while, but the telemetry data was recorded all the time. Could you look at it from a pilot's point of view to see if you could find anything suspicious?
