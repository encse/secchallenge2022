# Suspicious van

Hey bro!

You know where I work, right? So there is this van stopped outside next to us, and it is parking here for at least 3 days. It just looks shady, bro. It has tainted windows dark as the night, a big-ass antenna on top, and is dirty af.

Anyways, I told my colleague my mamma raised no weakling, imma head out and check it out for myself. I took my HackRF with me in my bag, and it looked like it was transmitting something in the 433MHz range, so I recorded it, but I can do nothing with it, bro. It makes no sense to me. Could you help me out?

I don't know if it helps, but there is a logo on the side saying: `Proudly supported by the RadioHead Packet Radio`.

Cheers, bro
